# Flexible Camera Parameters with HM3D

> This project is compeleted, minor modifications may added later

This project using [Unity](https://unity.com/) as the development tool to conduct a research about flexible camera configurations on [Habitat-Matterport 3D Research Dataset (HM3D)](https://aihabitat.org/datasets/hm3d/).

## Project Topic

Flexible camera configurations (regular pinhole, fisheye and panoramic lenses) in a semi-realistic rendering environment (HM3D) based on real scans where ground-truth for training is available (sceneflow, depth etc.)

## Progress

:white_check_mark: Fisheye camera effect

:white_check_mark: Panoramic images generation

:white_check_mark: Cubemap texture generation for cameras

:white_check_mark: Random camera (with different camera configurations) spawns within HM3D model

:white_check_mark: Editor-friendly interface
